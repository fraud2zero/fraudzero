8/18/2023: Project Creation, wrote manifesto

8/20/2023: Hunting for related reddits, found that [FraudPrevention](/r/FraudPrevention) was dormant, needed a moderator. Volunteered as moderator, got immediately approved, probably automagically. Worked through moderation queue. Learned a bit from reading approval requests. 

8/21/2023: Substantially reworked sub to have a few top-level posts. Started the Wiki. 

8/22/2023: More work on the sub. Pinned the report and prevent posts to the top. Moderator 101 course. 

8/23/2023: Reached out to Chase exec to see if I could get an hour with a DBA and a fraud person. 

8/24/2023: [Wellthatsucks](/r/Wellthatsucks) had an interesting thread about a scam. Joined [Scams](/r/Scams), generated some more content for the report and prevent posts based on some Google stuff I found that was pretty good. Took a bit of clicking to find the Google phishing reporter site, so worth the effort to bring that front and center. I should bookmark it in my own browser. Watched some scammer takedown videos, put their channels in the prevent post. Worked on folder structure and docs, I need to get on with some coding soon.
