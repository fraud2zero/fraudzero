# To Do #

This file tracks the plan and progress. 

1. Find appropriate Reddit to announce to.
**Complete!** became moderator of [FraudPrevention](https://www.reddit.com/r/FraudPrevention/) which has been a dead sub for 4 years or so.

2. Setup folder structure with README in each folder. 
3. Based on following reddit, think I should do some UserFocused tools first. 
4. LEOTools too. 
5. New Folders: Common, EndUserTools, ServerSideTools, Docs, LEOTools
6. README in each. 
7. Next up, EndUserTool/FraudScanner.py that will find the Netflix and AD10H fraud from a Chase transaction download. This will require Chase.columnmap.yml file to map the columns, and Python modules for Netflix and Common/DestinationNames.blacklist.yml. I'll defer on any actual reporting for now, except maybe a letter writer?
